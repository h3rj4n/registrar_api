Rough notes for remaining todo items:
1.0 TODOs:
 * Easy way to copy registrar contact information to all 4 groups
 * Allow admins to "hide" certain contact types from the end user
   (i.e. you might not want an end user to be able to set the admin and tech
   contact details).
 * Allow admins to set global details for certain contact types
 * Add support for extended domain attributes
 * More validation on input formats
 * Complete simpletests for the Registrar API functionality

Other TODOs:
 * Add support for setting nameservers on domain create
 * Add support for bringing in existing namecheap domains to drupal
 * Sync domains from the nameserver back into drupal
 * Integration with Aegir/Ubercart/Others?
 * Each registrar API should probably be implemented as a module,
   instead of just a .inc
