Rough notes for remaining todo items:
1.0 TODOs:
 * Easy way to copy registrar contact information to all 4 groups
 * Allow admins to "hide" certain contact types from the end user
   (i.e. you might not want an end user to be able to set the admin and tech
   contact details).
 * Allow admins to set global details for certain contact types
 * Add support for extended domain attributes
 * More validation on input formats
 * Complete simpletests for the Registrar API functionality

Other TODOs:
 * Add support for setting nameservers on domain create
 * Add support for bringing in existing namecheap domains to drupal
 * Sync domains from the nameserver back into drupal
 * Integration with Aegir/Ubercart/Others?
 * Each registrar API should probably be implemented as a module,
   instead of just a .inc
=======
Registrar API
=============


TODO:

* Review permissions.
* Move menu callbacks to registrar_api.admin.inc / registrar_api.pages.inc
* Themify some functions.

* Smart way to keep test credentials out of git
* Implement all calls
* complete test case 

After domain registration is stable:
* Import/sync options to integrate pre-existing dommains?
* Look into optional extra services of some api's e.g. SSL certificates
* Port to D7
