Registrar API
=============


TODO:

* Smart way to keep test credentials out of git
* Implement all calls
* complete test case 
* cleanup

After domain registration is stable:
* Import/sync options to integrate pre-existing dommains?
* Look into optional extra services of some api's e.g. SSL certificates
* Port to D7
